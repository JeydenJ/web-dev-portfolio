    <h3 class="project-card">Introduction</h3>

<p>Our team of eight members collaborated to develop a web application for <b>CirQuS</b>, focusing on creating an efficient and intuitive <b>user interface (UI)</b> and <b>user experience (UX)</b> while employing <b>Agile</b> scrum methodologies. We utilized <b>Jira</b> for project management and <b>Confluence</b> for documentation and collaboration. As a <b>web developer</b>, I played a key role in translating these designs into a fully functional application and developing critical features, including an email notification system.</p>

<h3 class="project-card">Role and Contributions</h3>
<p>In this project, my role as a <b>web developer</b> was centered around translating <b>UI/UX</b> designs into a functional and interactive web application. My key contributions included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developing an email notification system that allows users to set temperature thresholds for fridge monitoring and receive email alerts when these thresholds are exceeded. This system utilized an <b>API</b> to track and manage temperature data effectively.</li>
  <li>Assisting in the creation of an interactive graph that visualizes real-time data from the <b>CirQuS API</b>, enhancing the application's ability to provide immediate insights into temperature trends.</li>
  <li>Working closely with designers to implement their visual and interaction designs onto the web page, ensuring a seamless integration of <b>UI/UX</b> elements.</li>
  <li>Building and optimizing the application's front-end using modern web technologies such as <b>React.js</b> and <b>Node.js</b>, as well as <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>, to ensure responsiveness and accessibility.</li>
  <li>Collaborating with team members to ensure design consistency and adherence to best practices, while incorporating feedback to iteratively improve the applicationâ€™s functionality and user experience.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="project-card">Project Overview</h3>
<p>The <b>CirQuS Fridge Monitoring</b> web application was designed to provide real-time monitoring of fridge temperature for technology advisors. Using <b>React.js</b> and <b>Node.js</b>, we developed a platform that allows users to track temperature fluctuations and receive timely email notifications for any anomalies. I assisted in creating an interactive graph that visualizes real-time data from the <b>CirQuS API</b>, providing users with immediate insights into temperature trends and ensuring effective management of stored products.</p>

<h3 class="project-card">Target Audience</h3>
<p>The target audience for the <b>CirQuS Fridge Monitoring</b> web application consists of <b>technology advisors</b> who manage fridge systems across various environments. The application aimed to deliver a reliable and user-friendly solution to support their monitoring tasks and ensure the quality of stored goods.</p>

<h3 class="project-card">Results and Impact</h3>
<p>The project successfully delivered a feature-rich web application that met the needs of our target audience. Users appreciated the effective email notification system and the intuitive <b>UI/UX design</b>, which facilitated their monitoring tasks and improved their overall experience. The project demonstrated the impact of integrating well-designed features into a cohesive web application to achieve specific user needs and project goals.</p>

    <h3 class="project-card">Figma Design</h3>
    <p>This <b>Figma</b> design showcases the user interface for the <b>CirQuS Fridge Monitoring web application</b>. It includes
      wireframes, prototypes, and design mockups created to illustrate the layout, navigation, and interaction flow of
      the application.</p>
