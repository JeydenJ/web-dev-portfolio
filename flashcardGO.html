        <h2>FlashCardGO Project</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The <b>FlashcardGO</b> project is a group assignment for <b>Advanced Interaction Design</b> which is centered around addressing the needs of university students who rely on the NSW government train service for commuting to and from their campuses. Recognizing the challenges faced by these students, particularly in finding conducive environments for studying during transit, our team of 6 members embarked on a design journey to create a solution that enhances their learning experience.
            </p>
            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
            <p>Our target audience consists of <b>university students</b> who utilize the NSW government train service as their primary mode of transportation. These students often face challenges in finding suitable spaces to study effectively while commuting, leading to underutilized time during transit.
            </p>
            <h3>Results and Impact</h3>
            <p>Through the development of <b>FlashcardGO</b>, we successfully addressed the needs of our target audience by providing them with a convenient and efficient platform for studying during train commutes. The app's intuitive interface and synchronization with train schedules have empowered students to optimize their study sessions and make the most of their commuting time. As a result, users have reported increased productivity, improved academic performance, and a sense of empowerment in managing their study routines. <b>FlashcardGO</b> has made a tangible impact on the educational experiences of university students, illustrating the power of innovative design in fostering learning opportunities in unconventional settings.
